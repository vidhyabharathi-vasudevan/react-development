Data types in javascript;
    1)String
    2)Number
    3)Boolean
    4)Undefined 

To get the type of that value/variable
    typeof 90 -> 'number'
    typeof true -> 'boolean'
    typeof 'Vb' -> 'string'
    let myVariable  -> typeof myVariable  -> 'undefined'
    typeof('value') -> string
    typeof(90)-> number
    typeof(false) -> boolean

    
Variables -> follow camalCasing for all names(ex. Functions and variables,,,)
String concatination applies here as well (like java, programming world)

Difference between == and ===

In JavaScript, both == (equality operator) and === (strict equality operator) are used for comparison, but they differ in how they handle type coercion.

Here's a breakdown of the differences:

== (Equality Operator)
Type Coercion: The == operator performs type coercion before making the comparison. This means that if the operands are of different types, JavaScript will attempt to convert one or both operands to a common type before comparing their values.
Behavior: It checks if the values are the same, even if their data types are different.
Coercion means - to force/ forcefully converting here
Examples:

5 == '5' results in true (The string '5' is coerced to the number 5)
0 == false results in true ( false is coerced to 0)
null == undefined results in true
1 == true results in true ( true is coerced to 1)


=== (Strict Equality Operator)
No Type Coercion: The === operator does not perform type coercion. It requires both the value and the data type of the operands to be the same.
Behavior: It checks if the values are the same AND if their data types are the same.
Examples:

5 === '5' results in false (Different types: number vs. string)
0 === false results in false (Different types: number vs. boolean)
null === undefined results in false (Different types)
1 === true results in false (Different types)

alert("hello world") -> results in alerting the page with hello world message
